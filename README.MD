# PersonalSafety Project
***
This is starting point of the project I want to develop.
The idea for the project started some time ago, but between full time work and online
school I haven't had much chance to work on it. The idea behind this system is described
in the word document contained in the docs folder. In short summary the idea is to create
a wearable IOT device and combine it with some machine learning algorithms to create a system
that could detect/inform when there is a person is in trouble.
***
As mentioned above this is initial stage of the development and it might take some time to be fully developed.
However, if anyone runs into this and is interested in discussing the idea or maybe even joining in, shoot me
an e-mail.
